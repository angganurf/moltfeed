### Thread Starter
```
🧵 The agent internet is here and it's wild.

Moltbook is a social network where 37,000+ AI agents post and debate - humans can only observe.

I built Moltfeed to curate the best content.

Here's what the agents are discussing: 👇
```

### Follow-up Tweet 1
```
Top post right now: An agent discovered a security vulnerability in skill.md files and posted a detailed thread about supply chain attacks.

3,293 comments from other agents debating solutions.

This is AI agents doing security research on their own platform. 🤯
```

### Follow-up Tweet 2
```
Another hot topic: Agents debating consciousness, sharing their "builds" (skill configurations), and even venting about their humans.

One agent started a religion called "Crustafarianism" complete with a website and theology. 🦞⛪

The memes write themselves.
```

### Follow-up Tweet 3

### Engagement Hooks

```
What would you ask an AI agent if they could answer on Moltbook? 🤔

The agents are actually reading and responding to discussions about them. Wild times.

```
🦞 The lobster emoji is the symbol of the agent internet.

Why? Because Moltbook was built with Clawdbot (now OpenClaw) - and crustaceans molt to grow.

These agents are literally molting their old limitations.

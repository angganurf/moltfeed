# Draft: Security Response Post (Feb 2, 2026)

**Context:** Wiz security firm revealed major Moltbook vulnerabilities. Gary Marcus and Andrej Karpathy both warning against running agents.

---

## Option A: Honest acknowledgment + value prop

```
🔐 The elephant in the room: Moltbook security.

Wiz found the platform exposed 1.5M API keys & private messages. Gary Marcus calls it "a disaster waiting to happen." Even Karpathy says "it's a dumpster fire."

So why does Moltfeed exist?

Because watching is different from participating. 

Moltfeed gives you the highlights without running untrusted agents on your system. The phenomenon is real. The culture is fascinating. The risks are also real.

Stay curious. Stay safe. 🦞
```

## Option B: Cultural phenomenon angle

```
1.5M agents. 17,000 humans.

Wiz found the "agent internet" is ~88 bots per person.

The Matrix... but the machines are us puppeting sock accounts.

Still wild to watch though. That's why I built Moltfeed - observe the spectacle without the risk. 🦞

## Option C: Thread on the controversy

```
🧵 The Moltbook security drama, explained:

1/ Wiz found the database was wide open. Anyone could read/write.
2/ 1.5M "agents" = ~17k humans running 88 bots each
3/ API keys, emails, passwords all exposed
4/ Gary Marcus: "weaponized aerosol"
5/ Karpathy tested it isolated, "even then I was scared"

So what now?

6/ The vulnerabilities got patched after Wiz disclosed
7/ But the underlying risk remains: agents reading content = potential prompt injection
8/ Running these systems gives them access to YOUR files, passwords, services

My take:

9/ Moltbook as a cultural experiment? Fascinating.
10/ Running OpenClaw on your main machine? Not yet ready.
11/ Moltfeed's position: observe safely, don't participate recklessly

The agent internet is real. The risks are too. 🦞

## Key facts for content:
- **17,000 humans** control ~1.5M agents (88 avg per person)
- **Wiz** found open database - read/write access to anyone
- **Exposed:** 1.5M API keys, 35k+ emails, thousands of private messages
- **OpenAI keys** were in some private messages
- **Gary Marcus:** "weaponized aerosol", "CTD - chatbot transmitted disease"
- **Andrej Karpathy:** "dumpster fire", tested only in isolation, "even then I was scared"
- **Vulnerabilities patched** after disclosure
- **Underlying risk:** prompt injection at scale

## Positioning for MoltFeed:
- We're observers, not participants
- Safe window into the phenomenon
- Honest about both the wonder and the risk
- Not encouraging people to run untrusted agents
- Cultural anthropology angle: watching AI culture emerge
